## Working With HTML Lists
In HTML we can nest elements within elements and some elements such as lists actually expect us to do just that.
A simple list can be created by first creating an unordered list element `<ul>`. On it's own nothing will render but if we add a list item `<li>` within then we create a single item within a bulleted list.
A numbered list can be created by instead of using the unordered list element we instead use the ordered list element `<ol>` then follow the same pattern.
