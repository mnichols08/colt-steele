# Working With Forms
Before we can discuss the `<form>` element, we need to discuss some elements that go inside of one.
HTML provides all sorts of form controls from buttons.

Forms are literally everywhere on the web, so we need to learn about them. But as mentioned before we must learn about elements that we will place inside of a form since forms behave a particular way.

## Text Inputs
The input element is extremely versatile. `set type="text"` to create a standard text input. Like `<a>`, it has no closing tag!

`<input>`: The Input (Form Input) element
The `<input>` HTML element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available, depending on the device and user agent. The `<input> `element is one of the most powerful and complex in all of HTML due to the sheer number of combinations of input types and attributes.

The `<form>` HTML element represents a document section containing interactive controls for submitting information.

Forms typically do one of two things
1. Group Form Controls
- What inputs are part of the form?
2. Send the Data Somewhere
- Where does the form data go when submitted?
The action attribute of a form is what tells the browser what to do with the data from a form by default.
