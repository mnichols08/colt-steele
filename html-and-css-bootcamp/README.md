# The HTML & CSS Bootcamp
This is a course by Colt Steele on HTML and CSS. He claims this is his officially his favorite course to teach. In this course we will build a variety of websites using HTML and CSS. This course is designed for anybody that knows how to use a computer! He suggests to skip the HTML because it is boring to someone who understands. 

# How does the web work?
The World Wide Web is an information system where documents are available over the Internet. These documents are transferred via a protocol known as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Transport Protocol)
It is a formally defined set of rules for communicatioonb etween a client (requestor) and a server (responder). This ia about as far as we need to go as far as writing basic HTML and CSS.
