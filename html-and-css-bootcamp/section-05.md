## [Span](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span)
`<span>:` The Content Span element
The `<span>` HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. `<span>` is very much like a `<div>` element, but `<div>` is a block-level element whereas a `<span>` is an inline element.
- Spans are generic inline elemnts. They have no special meaning but can be styled later using CSS.
