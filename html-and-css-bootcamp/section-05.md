# Other Elements

## [Span](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span)s
`<span>:` The Content Span element
The `<span>` HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. `<span>` is very much like a `<div>` element, but `<div>` is a block-level element whereas a `<span>` is an inline element.
- Spans are generic **inline** elements. They have no special meaning but can be styled later using CSS.

## [Div](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div)s
`<div>`: The Content Division element
The `<div>` HTML element is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like Flexbox is applied to its parent element).
- Divs are generic containers that have no inherent meaning. They are used to group content together for styling.

## [Table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table)s
`<table>`: The Table element
The `<table>` HTML element represents tabular data â€” that is, information presented in a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data.
