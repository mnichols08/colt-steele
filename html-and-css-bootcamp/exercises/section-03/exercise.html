    <p>Fresh pasta is not somethign to master in one go. It takes time and practice but it yields dividends. This particualar recipe is vastly versatile. It can be made into whole grain pasta, by swapping in one cup sifted whole wheat, spelt or farror flour in place of one cup all-purpose for double zero flour. Add more egg yolks or water as needed and the rest the dough for one hour. Or try a green pasta, as in this ravioli verdi: Steam or saute six ounces of baby spinach (about six cups) until just wilted. Spread it out on a parchment-lined baking sheet, and, when cool, squeeze water out thoroughly, a handful at a time, and then chop roughly. Puree with two eggs and one egg yolk, then use this mixture in place of eggs in the recipe. Or, for something a little different, make an herbed pasta, like this pappardelle, by stirring in half cup finely chopped parsley, chives, chervil, tarragon, or basil in any combination to the eggs before adding to the flour in the main recipe.</p>
