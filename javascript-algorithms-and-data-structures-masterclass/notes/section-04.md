# Algorithms and Problem Solving Patterns

## Objectives
- Define what an algorithm is
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms
- Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

## What is an Algorithm?
A **process** or **set of steps** to accomplish a certain task.

# Why do I need to know this?
Almost everything that you do in programming involves some kind of algorithm!
It is the foundation for being a successful problem solving and developer
