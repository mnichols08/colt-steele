# Section 9 - Working With Files
Useful Terms - Cat, Less, Head, Tail, Sort, WC

cat - The cat command concatenates and prints the contents of files.

`cat <filename>` - will read the contents of a file and print them out. For example, cat instructions.txt will read in from the instructions.txt file and then print the contents out to the screen.

It is sort of like ls but lists the contents of a file directly in the terminal. It can be useful if you are working on the command line of a server to view the contents of a file quickly without opening a text editor and reading it and then exiting.

The concatenation part comes from cat. It allows us to take multiple files as inputs and output a single phrase
