- the file Command

### touch 
touch allows us to create a new file from the command line. If you provide a filename that already exists as a filename it will simply update that file's modification dates. Otherwise it will create a blank file with the name provided. 
For Example: Typing `touch catalog.txt` and submitting will create a new file in the currect directory with the filename of `catalog.txt`
