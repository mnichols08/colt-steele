# Section 06 - Creating Files & Folders

## Important:
- touch Command
- mkdir Command
## Useful: 
- Good vs. Horrible File Names
## Nice to Have
- the file Command

### touch 
touch allows us to create a new file from the command line. If you provide a filename that already exists as a filename it will simply update that file's modification dates. Otherwise it will create a blank file with the name provided. 
For Example: Typing `touch catalog.txt` and submitting will create a new file in the currect directory with the filename of `catalog.txt`

It will always create blank files with or without whatever extension provided.
We can provide a relative or absolute path as a prefix to the filename to create a file anywhere anytime from a single line of code!
