# Piping & Constructing Pipelines
The most important thing to learn in this section is what a pipeline is and how to write one.
We will learn about the tr command which is nice-to-have but will also lean about the tee command which is a little more useful but not as imporant as piping.

When it comes to piping, a command accepting standard input is really what glues everything together.
Pipes are used to redirect a stream from one program to another program. We can take the output of one command and redirect it to the input of another.
