## Standard Streams
	The three standard streams are **communication channels** between a computer program and its environment.
	They are:
	1. Standard Input
	- 
	2. Standard Output
	- Standard Output is a place to which a computer or command can send information. The information could go to a screen to be displayed, to a file, or even to a printer or other devices.
	- By default our terminal outputs directly to our terminal.
	- It is possible to change our output to something different such as saving to a file.
	3. Standard Error
	- By default any errors are displayed within the terminal.
	- It is possible to change where we output errors.
