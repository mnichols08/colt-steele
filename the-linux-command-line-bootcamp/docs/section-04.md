All about getting help - finding documentation...

If you seen this command or were told to run `ncal -w` how might you know what `-w` would do?

Well, that is where the `man` pages come in.
just type `man` and see

well it wants an argument so lets try
`man ncal`

Man will enter the file viewer. press `q` to exit if you want to get out of the reader.
space is a nice shortcut to scroll down an entire page

`b` can take you back and `f` can also take you forward

This is a program called LESS

so what is the `-w` in `ncal`?
lets see


to search within a LESS file, you can type `/` and then type in something to search for and find out
`-w` means we get the week number
