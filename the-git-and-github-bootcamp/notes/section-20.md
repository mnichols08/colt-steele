# Git Aliases
# Global Git Config
Git looks for the global config file at either `~/.gitconfig` or `~/.config/git/config`. Any configuration variables that we change in the file will be applied across all Git repositories.
We can also alter alter configuration variables from the command line if preferred.

# Adding Aliases
We can easily set up Git aliases to make our Git experience a bit simpler and faster.
For example, we could define an alias `git ci` instead of having to type `git commit`
Or, we could define a custom `git lg` command that prints out a custom formated commit log.
