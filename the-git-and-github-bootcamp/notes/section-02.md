# What is Git?
Git is a version control system - one of the most popular ones at that.
Essentially it is software that tracks and manages changes to files over time.
Generally allow users to revisit earlier versions of the files, compare changes between versions, undo changes, and a whole lot more
* We will go into more detail shortly!

Git is just one VCS
Git is just one of many version control systems available today. Other well-known ones include Subversion, SVS, and Mercurial.
They all have similar goals, but vary significantly in how they achieve those goals. Fortunately, we only need to care about Git because...

Git is just simply put the most widely used VCS out there.

Life Without Git

Git-ing To The Point
What exactly does Git do for us?
Git helps us...
- Track changes across multiple files
- Compare versions of a project
- Time travel back to old versions
- Revert to a previous version
- Collaborate and share changes
- Combine changes

Git allows us to create checkpoints - like save states.
The more we commit the more options we have to move back to a previous checkpoint.

A Tiny Bit of Git History
Linus Torvalds is a legendary software engineer. He is the creator and main developer behind Linux and Git!
In 2005, while working on Linux, he became frustrate with the available version control systems. The existing tools were slow, closed-cource, and usually paid.
The Birth of Git
Torvalds wanted a version control system that was super fast AND free, unlike the existing tools.
On April 3rd 2005 he got to work on his own VCS, which would become Git. In a matter of days he had most basic funcionality done.

The first official Git release came a couple months later. 15 years later in 2020, over 90% of developers worldwide use Git on a daily basis!

Linus referred to Git as "the stupid content tracker" while he was working on it. Eventually he settled on the name Git.
The official Git source code explains a courple different meanings for the name, depending on your mood:
* a random three-letter combiation that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command.
* stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple
* "global information tracker": You're in a good mood, and it actually workds for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
* "g#ddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks

Engineers & Coders
From massive tech giants like Facebook and Google to the tiniest of startups, developers across the globe use Git. If you plan on becoming a developer, Git is essentially a must-have.

Tech-Adjacent Roles
Many people in non-developer role end up learning the basics of Git to collaborate with their coworkers. Desiners in particular often need to work with Git.

Governments
In recent years, governments have started using Git to manage the drafting of laws. Washington DC City council uses Git & Github to publish its laws. Citizens even have found and fied typos collaboratively using Git!

Scientists
Git is commonly used by research teams at universities and agencies around the world to manage code, data sets, and more. Git and Github is especially powerful in the peer-reviewed world of science and research.

Writers
Some writers love using Git to manage drafts of complex novels, screenplays, or other works with lots of moving parts and constant changes across multiple files.
In particular, Git is gaining popularity for use in collaborative textbook writing with multiple authors.

Anyone Really
People find very creative uses for Git ranging from keeping a daily diary to keeping PhD theses to tracking changes to photoshop files. At least one composer writes his symphonies using Git!

Git != Github
Git is the VCS that runs locally on your machine. You do not need to register for an account. You do need the internet to use it.
Github is a service that hosts Git repositories in the cloud and makes it easier to collaborate with other people.
