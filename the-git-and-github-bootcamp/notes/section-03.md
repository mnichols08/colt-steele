# Git & Github Installation

## Where Do We Start?
Git is (primarily) a terminal tool
Git was created as a command-line tool. To use it, we run various git commands in a Unix shell. This is not the most user-friendly experience, but it is at the very core of Git!

## The Rise of GUI's
Over the last few years, companies have created graphical user interfaces for Git that allow people to use Git without having to be a command-line expert.
Popular Git GUIs include: 
- GitHub Desktop
- SourceTree
- Tower
- GitKraken
- Ungit

## GUI Clients
Pros | Cons
- | -
- Way lower barrier-of-entry for beginners compared to the command-line. | - At times, there is a lot of "magic" involved. The inner-workings of Git are obfuscated and hidden away with a GUI
- Friendlier to use. Can be a much better experience (when it works) | - Often leads to dependance on a particular piece of software
- Some people prefer the visual experience, even those who can use the command-line | - When things go seriously wrong, it can be very challenging to fix without the command-line
 | - The interfaces, buttons, and menus vary between different GUIs

 ## The Command Line
 Pros | Cons
 - Git is a command-line tool. All of the documentation and resources online will refer to the command-line | - Not beginner friendly. At All. Can be difficult to learn and remember the commands at first.
 - The command-line can be way faster once you get comfortable with it! | Even for some practiced users, the command-line interface is just not a good experience. It is really a matter of preference
 - Some of the more advanced Git features are only available to the command-line |
 - The commands are always the same, no matter what machine you are on! |

There is a lot of stupid GUI gate-keeping
Are you a developer? yes
Do you plan on becoming a developer? yes
Learn the Comamand Line! OK

## Installing Git
Installing Git locally is slightly trickier, depending on your specific operating system.
Git is intented to run on Unix-style systems like Linux and MacOS, so if you are on a Windows machine you may need to take a couple extra steps.
