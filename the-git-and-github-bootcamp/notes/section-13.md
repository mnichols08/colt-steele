# Github Odds & Ends

## Public vs. Private Repos
### Public Repos
Public repositories are accessible to everybody on the internet. Anyone with access to Github can see the repo
### Private
Private repositories are only accessible to the owner and people who have been granted access.

## Deleting Github Repositories

## Adding Collaborators

## READMEs
A README file is used to communicate important information about a repository including:
- What the project does
- How to run the project
- Why it is noteworty
- Who maintains the project
If you put a README in the root of your project, Github will recognize it and automatically display it on the repo's home page. (also inside of a docs folder automagically)
READMEs are Markdown files, ending with the `.md` extension. Markdown is a convenient syntax to generate formatted text. It is easy to pick up!

## Markdown Syntax
Markdown syntax supports the following:
- Headings
- Text Styles (bolt, italics, etc.)
- Code Blocks
- Lists (ordered, and unordered)
- Links
- Images
- And More!

## Markdown Headings
In Markdown, we can write six different levels of headings, all using the # character.
- `#` The Largest Heading
- `##` The Second Largest Heading
- `###` The Third Largest Heading
- ...
- `######` The Smallest Heading

## Github Gists
Github Gists are a simple way to share code snippets and useful fragments to others. Gists are much easier to create, but offer far fewer features than a typical github repository.

## Github Pages
Github Pages are public webpages that are hosted and published via Github. They allow you to create a website simply by pushing your code to Github.

## Static Sites
Github Pages is a hosting service for static webpages, so it does not support server-side code like Pyton, Ruby, or Node. Just HTML/CSS/JS!

## User Site vs Project Sites
User Site | Project Sites
- | -
You get one user site per Github account. This is where you could host a portfolio site or some form of personal website. The default url is based on your Github username, followingthis pattern: username.github.io, though you can change this! | You get unlimited project sites! Each Github repo can have a corresponding hsoted website. It is as simple as telling Github which specific branch contains the web content. The default urls follow this pattern: `username.github.io/repo-name`
